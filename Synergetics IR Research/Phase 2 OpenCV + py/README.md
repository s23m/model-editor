# S23M Model Editor

## Image Recognition Research Project
Implementation of OpenCV Python library to attempt to recognise shapes in given image files.

### How to Use
By default, the script reads in an image called `input.png`. If you wish to change this, go to line 6 of the file and change `input.png` to whatever input file you wish. Once any desired changes have been configured, open a terminal and navigate to where the script is located and type:

`python FinalOutput.py`

And hit ENTER.

The program will open a window called `Mask` with the results of the operation. To exit, just close the window and the program will close.
